## Filtering Columns and Rows

with SQL, you can filter columns with SELECT and rows with WHERE.  Lets try an expample with the Lahman baseball database. First, we need to load the appropriate packages. 
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```
Now, suppose we would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. We could write the following

```{r}
query<-"Select playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting 
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)



```
